But before we get there, I'll give you a little information about the castle and what our visit will include. So in fact, there's been a castle on this site for over 1100 years, the first building was a fort constructed in 914 ad for defence against Danish invaders Mike king Alfred, the great daughter enruled England at the time.   Speaker 1 (00:30) In the following century after the normans conquered in England the land was given to a nobleman called Richard de Vere and he built a castle there that stayed in the de Vere family for over 400 years. However, when Queen Elizabeth, the first announced that she was going to visit the castle in 1576, it was beginning to look a bit, run down, and it was decided that rather than repair the guest rooms they'd make a new house for a out of wood next to the main hall she stayed there for 4 nights, and apparently it was very luxurious.   Speaker 1 (01:05) But unfortunately, it was destroyed a few years later by fire. In the 17th century, the castle belonged to the wealthy fenis family who enlarged it and made it more comfortable. However, / 1982, the fenice family could no longer afford to maintain the castle, even though they receive government support and they put it on the market.   Speaker 1 (01:30) It was eventually taken over by a company who owned a number of amusement parks, but when we get there, I think you'll see that they've managed to retain the original atmosphere of the castle. When you go inside, you will find that in the stable rooms, there are life like moving wax models dressed in costumes of different periods in the past, which even carry on conversations together, as well as that in every room, there are booklets, giving information about what the room was used for. And the history of the object, some furniture it contains The castle park's quite extensive, a one time sheep were kept there and in the 19th century, the owners had a little zoo with animals like rabbits and even a baby elephant.",

      "message": "Speaker 1 (00:00) Hi, Alex. It's Martha kinds here. James white gave me your number.   Speaker 1 (00:05) I hope you don't mind me calling you   Speaker 2 (00:08) Of course, not. How are you, Martha?   Speaker 1 (00:12) I'm readying because I need a bit of advice.   Speaker 2 (00:15) Oh yeah? What about   Speaker 1 (00:16) The training you did at jpnw, a few years ago. I'm applying for the same thing.   Speaker 2 (00:22) Oh right. Yes, I did mine in 2014 best thing I ever did. I'm still working there   Speaker 1 (00:28) Really, what are you doing?   Speaker 2 (00:31) Well, now I work in the customer services department, but I did my initial training in finance. I stayed there for the first 2 years and then moved to where I am now.   Speaker 1 (00:41) That's the same department I'm applying for did you enjoy it?   Speaker 2 (00:45) Ah, I was pretty nervous to begin with. I didn't do well in my exams at school, and I was really worried because I failed Matt, but it didn't actually matter, because I did lots of courses on the job.   Speaker 1 (00:56) Did you get a diplomat the end of your training period I'm hoping to do the one in business skills.   Speaker 2 (01:03) Yes, that sounds good. I took the one on it skills, but I wish I'd done that one instead.   Speaker 1 (01:09) Okay, that's good to know what about the other trainees, but how did you get on with them?   Speaker 2 (01:16) There were about 20 of us who started at the same time and we were all around the same age, I was 18, and there was only one person younger than me who was 17. The rest were between 18 and 20I made some good friends.   Speaker 1 (01:31) I had lots of good things about the training at jpnw. It seems like there are a lot of opportunities there.   Speaker 2 (01:39) Yeah, definitely because of its size. You can work in loads of different areas within the organisation.   Speaker 1 (01:45) What about pay? I know? You get a lower minimum wage than regular employees   Speaker 2 (01:51) That's right, which isn't great. But you get the same number of days holiday as everyone else and the pay goes up massively if they offer you a job at the end of the training period   Speaker 1 (02:01) Yeah, but I'm not doing it for the money, it's the experience I think will be really useful. Everyone says by the end of the year you gained so much confidence.   Speaker 2 (02:11) You're right. That's the most useful part about it. There's a lot of variety too you're given lots of different things to do I enjoyed it all.   Speaker 2 (02:20) I didn't even didn't mind the studying.   Speaker 1 (02:23) Do you have to spend anytime in college?   Speaker 2 (02:25) Yes, 1 day each month, so you get lots of support from both your tutor and your manager.   Speaker 1 (02:33) And the company is easy to get to, isn't it?   Speaker 2 (02:36) Yes, it's very close to the train station. So the locations are real advantage. Speaker 1 (00:01) We'll be arriving at branley castle in about 5 minutes. But before we get there, I'll give you a little information about the castle and what our visit will include. So in fact, there's been a castle on this site for over 1100 years, the first building was a fort constructed in 914 ad for defence against Danish invaders Mike king Alfred, the great daughter enruled England at the time.   Speaker 1 (00:30) In the following century after the normans conquered in England the land was given to a nobleman called Richard de Vere and he built a castle there that stayed in the de Vere family for over 400 years. However, when Queen Elizabeth, the first announced that she was going to visit the castle in 1576, it was beginning to look a bit, run down, and it was decided that rather than repair the guest rooms they'd make a new house for a out of wood next to the main hall she stayed there for 4 nights, and apparently it was very luxurious.   Speaker 1 (01:05) But unfortunately, it was destroyed a few years later by fire. In the 17th century, the castle belonged to the wealthy fenis family who enlarged it and made it more comfortable. However, / 1982, the fenice family could no longer afford to maintain the castle, even though they receive government support and they put it on the market.   Speaker 1 (01:30) It was eventually taken over by a company who owned a number of amusement parks, but when we get there, I think you'll see that they've managed to retain the original atmosphere of the castle. When you go inside, you will find that in the stable rooms, there are life like moving wax models dressed in costumes of different periods in the past, which even carry on conversations together, as well as that in every room, there are booklets, giving information about what the room was used for. And the history of the object, some furniture it contains The castle park's quite extensive, a one time sheep were kept there and in the 19th century, the owners had a little zoo with animals like rabbits and even a baby elephant.",
