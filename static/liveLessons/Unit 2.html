    <h2>Used to & Would – Talking About the Past</h2>

    <h3>1. Used to</h3>
    <p><strong>Form:</strong> <code>used to + base verb</code></p>
    <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Describes past habits or states that are no longer true.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>I <strong>used to live</strong> in Spain. (but now I don’t)</li>
      <li>She <strong>used to have</strong> long hair. (now she doesn’t)</li>
      <li>We <strong>didn’t use to like</strong> sushi, but now we do.</li>
      <li><strong>Did</strong> you <strong>use to go</strong> to that school?</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>We use “did/didn’t” in questions/negatives:  
        <em>Did you <strong>use to</strong> play football?</em></li>
      <li><em>Not:</em> ❌ <strong>Did you used to</strong>...</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Would</h3>
    <p><strong>Form:</strong> <code>would + base verb</code></p>
    <p><strong>Usage:</strong> Describes repeated past actions (habits), NOT states.</p>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Every summer, we <strong>would go</strong> to the beach.</li>
      <li>My dad <strong>would tell</strong> us stories before bed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>⚠️ Don’t use "would" for past states:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>❌ I <strong>would be</strong> shy.  
        ✅ I <strong>used to be</strong> shy.</li>
      <li>❌ He <strong>would have</strong> a car.  
        ✅ He <strong>used to have</strong> a car.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Compare:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>When I was a child, I <strong>used to love</strong> cartoons. ✅ (state)</li>
      <li>Every Saturday, we <strong>would ride</strong> our bikes for hours. ✅ (habit)</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="tab-title">Unit 7.2: Questions – Object, Subject & Indirect</div>
  <h3>1. Subject Questions</h3>
<p>These ask *who* or *what* is doing the action. The word order is like a normal sentence.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Who</strong> called you? <em>(subject = who)</em></li>
  <li><strong>What</strong> happened next?</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Object Questions</h3>
<p>These ask about the object of the verb. They use auxiliary verbs like <code>do/does/did</code>.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Who</strong> did you call?</li>
  <li><strong>What</strong> did she break?</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Indirect Questions</h3>
<p>These are more polite or formal. Use them in reported speech or to sound more polite.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Direct:</strong> Where is the station?  
    <br><strong>Indirect:</strong> Could you tell me <em>where the station is?</em></li>
  <li><strong>Direct:</strong> What time does the train leave?  
    <br><strong>Indirect:</strong> Do you know <em>what time the train leaves?</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In indirect questions, we don’t use <code>do/does/did</code> and the word order changes.</p>

<div class="tab-title">Unit 7.3: Understanding Paraphrasing</div>
<h3>1. Using synonyms</h3>
<p>Replace words with similar meanings.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Original: He <strong>helped</strong> me a lot.  
    <br>Paraphrase: He <strong>assisted</strong> me greatly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Changing grammar structures</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Active to passive:  
    <br>Original: They <strong>built</strong> the house.  
    <br>Paraphrase: The house <strong>was built</strong> by them.</li>
  <li>Changing clause types:  
    <br>Original: Although it was late, she stayed.  
    <br>Paraphrase: <strong>Despite</strong> being late, she stayed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Simplifying or combining ideas</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Original: He was tired. He went to bed early.  
    <br>Paraphrase: <strong>Because</strong> he was tired, he went to bed early.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why paraphrase?</strong>  
  To show understanding, vary your language, avoid repetition, and improve clarity.</p>
