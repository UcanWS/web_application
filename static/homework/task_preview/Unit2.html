    <h2>Narrative Forms</h2>
    <p>
      Narrative forms are verb tenses and structures used to tell stories or describe past events. The most common ones include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Past Simple</strong> — used for completed actions in the past.
        <br><em>Example: She <strong>went</strong> to the market yesterday.</em>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Past Continuous</strong> — used for ongoing actions in the past or background situations.
        <br><em>Example: I <strong>was walking</strong> when it started to rain.</em>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Past Perfect</strong> — used to show one action happened before another in the past.
        <br><em>Example: He <strong>had left</strong> before I arrived.</em>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Past Perfect Continuous</strong> — emphasizes duration before something in the past.
        <br><em>Example: They <strong>had been waiting</strong> for hours.</em>
