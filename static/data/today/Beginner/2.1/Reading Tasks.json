It happens when something tickles the inside of your nose. This could be dust, pollen, smoke, or even strong smells.</p>\n<p>When you sneeze, your body is trying to clean your nose. It pushes out the bad things. That is why sneezing is healthy. It protects your lungs and keeps your nose clean.</p>\n<p>Some people sneeze many times in a row. Some people make loud sneezes, others quiet ones. If you sneeze a lot every day, you might have allergies. Then it is good to talk to a doctor.</p>\n<p>So, sneezing is funny, but it is also important for your health!</p>",
