Sleep helps us stay healthy, think better, and feel good.</p>\n<p>Most people sleep at night. Adults need about 7 to 9 hours of sleep. Children and babies need more. If we don’t sleep enough, we feel tired, sad, or sick.</p>\n<p>Good sleep means going to bed at the same time every night. It also helps to turn off lights and phones. Drinking warm milk or reading a book can help you relax before bed.</p>\n<p>So remember — sleep is not just rest. It’s part of staying strong and happy!</p>",
