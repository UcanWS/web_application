It can be loud or quiet. It can smell bad or have no smell.</p>\n<p>Why do we fart? We fart because we eat food. When we eat, our body makes gas. Some foods make more gas. For example, beans, eggs, cabbage, and soda make more gas. This gas must go out. That is why we fart.</p>\n<p>Farts are not always bad. They show that your body is working. They also help your stomach feel better. But sometimes, too much gas can make your stomach hurt. If you have a lot of gas every day, it is good to talk to a doctor.</p>\n<p>So, farting is funny, but it is also healthy!</p>",
