They happen when we sleep — mostly during deep sleep.</p>\n<p>Our brain is still busy when we sleep. It makes pictures, sounds, and stories. These are our dreams. Sometimes we remember them, sometimes we forget.</p>\n<p>Scientists don’t know exactly why we dream. Maybe dreams help us learn or feel better. Some people even write their dreams in a notebook when they wake up!</p>\n<p>To dream well, get good sleep. Turn off your phone, close your eyes, and relax. Who knows? Maybe tonight you’ll fly to the moon!</p>",
