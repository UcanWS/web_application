Each team tries to destroy the enemy’s base. The game is fast and exciting!</p>\n<p>There are many heroes in MLBB. My favorite hero is Layla. She uses a big cannon and attacks from far away. Some heroes are fighters, some are tanks, and some are supports. You must choose the best hero for your team.</p>\n<p>I usually play in the evening after school. I play with my friends online. We talk and plan our strategy. It’s more fun when we win together!</p>\n<p>MLBB is not just a game. It helps me think fast, work in a team, and have fun with my friends.</p>",
